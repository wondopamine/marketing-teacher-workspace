/**
 * Header placement contract — header now lives INSIDE the hero scene.
 *
 * The earlier contract (banner outside <main>, banner outside any
 * transform parent) was a stacking-context guardrail for a persistent
 * site-wide nav. The current design intentionally pulls the header into
 * the paper-card so it scales/fades with the hero. The two stacking
 * concerns no longer apply because the header is part of the one-shot
 * hero scene rather than a persistent overlay.
 *
 * What still matters and is asserted here:
 *   - The page exposes exactly 1 banner, 1 main, 1 contentinfo landmark.
 *   - The banner sits inside <main> as part of the hero composition.
 *   - The choreography subtree mounts (non-empty <main>).
